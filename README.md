LetsCookIt - Recipes management system - Java, Spring (Boot, MVC, Security), JPA data
Multi-user web service for managing recipes  (store, retrieve, delete, search and update).
this is a Level 2 RESTful API, the API was developed with the following principles in mind:
1. Loosely coupled Architecture.
2. Layered Architecture(presentational, business, persistence and database).
3. Basic Security:
 -Registration process.
 -Everyone can see recipes of others but only the creator can modify/delete a recipe.
